# Provision a REAL Obsidian binary for the e2e suite (see e2e/obsidianHarness.ts).
#
# WHY this exists: `npm run test:e2e` drives a real Obsidian (Electron), but the
# binary is NOT an npm dependency. On Linux / Docker this downloads a PINNED
# Obsidian release once, caches it under `.tmp/`, and prints the binary path on
# stdout so `run-e2e.sh` can export OBSIDIAN_PATH. All progress goes to stderr so
# stdout stays a single clean path line for `$(...)` capture.
#
# WHY the tarball (not the AppImage): it extracts to a plain directory with a
# runnable `obsidian` binary — no FUSE and no `--appimage-extract`, both of which
# the CI/Docker container lacks (no fusermount).
#
# Pinned on purpose: the harness comments/behaviour are verified against this
# version, and a floating "latest" would let a new Obsidian release break e2e
# with NO code change. Bump OBSIDIAN_VERSION deliberately.
#
# WHY-NOT integrity checksum: Obsidian publishes a hash only for the `.asar`
# payload, not the platform tarball; `curl --fail` + `tar` validity is the 80/20
# guard. Revisit if a pinned asset is ever re-published.
#
# Non-Linux: no auto-download (Obsidian ships .dmg/.exe, not a drop-in binary).
# Set OBSIDIAN_PATH yourself — see obsidianHarness.resolveObsidianPath().
